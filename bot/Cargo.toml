# we want the entire runtime to stop upon approaching a panic.
#
# in the console during development, it is hard to notice that a task panicked
# and stopping the entire process is a good way to enforce the idea that panics
# should never happen.
[profile.dev]
panic = "abort"

# panics are enabled for release mode, since uptime is the highest priority and
# not necessarily correctness.
